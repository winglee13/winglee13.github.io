            <h2>Visualization 1: Distribution of Building Usage Across Congressional Districts</h2>
            <p>
                For the first visualization, I created a bar chart to illustrate the distribution of building usage across different congressional districts. Each bar represents a congressional district, and the height of the bar indicates the count of buildings in that district. I encoded the congressional district on the x-axis and the count of buildings on the y-axis. Additionally, I applied a color scheme to differentiate between different usage descriptions, allowing viewers to easily identify the predominant types of buildings in each district.

                In terms of data transformations, I preprocessed the dataset by filtering out any rows with missing values and grouped the data by congressional district and usage description to obtain the count of buildings for each category. This preprocessing step ensures that the data is clean and ready for visualization. To handle potential errors related to the maximum number of rows, I used Altair's <code>alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()</code> function.

                For interactivity, I enabled tooltips in the bar chart so that viewers can hover over each bar to see additional information such as the exact count of buildings and the specific usage description. This interactivity enhances the clarity of the visualization by providing users with detailed insights without cluttering the chart.

            <h2>Visualization 2: Relationship Between Year Acquired and Square Footage</h2>
            <p>
                For the second visualization, I created an interactive scatter plot showing the relationship between the year a building was acquired and its square footage. Each point on the plot represents a building, with the x-axis representing the year acquired and the y-axis representing the square footage. I used a sequential color scheme to represent the usage description, enabling viewers to visually identify different types of buildings based on their colors.

                In the Python notebook, I imported the dataset using its URL, performed data cleaning and preprocessing, and then used Altair to create the visualizations. I made sure to include a link to the dataset and the Python notebook in my GitHub repository for reference. This ensures transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.

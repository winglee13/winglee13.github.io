This is my submission for my homework 8 assignment.

## 1. Visualization Num. 1

For the first visualization, I created a bar chart to illustrate the distribution of building usage across different congressional districts. Each bar represents a congressional district, and the height of the bar indicates the count of buildings in that district. I encoded the congressional district on the x-axis and the count of buildings on the y-axis. Additionally, I applied a color scheme to differentiate between different usage descriptions, allowing viewers to easily identify the predominant types of buildings in each district. In terms of data transformations, I preprocessed the dataset by filtering out any rows with missing values and grouped the data by congressional district and usage description to obtain the count of buildings for each category.

## 2. Visualization Num. 2

For the second visualization, I created an interactive scatter plot showing the relationship between the year a building was acquired and its square footage. Each point on the plot represents a building, with the x-axis representing the year acquired and the y-axis representing the square footage. I used a sequential color scheme to represent the usage description, enabling viewers to visually identify different types of buildings based on their colors.
